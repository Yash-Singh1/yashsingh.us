# Roblox is Finally on Ubuntu!

> On June 11, 2021, a user by the name of `ImSlappy826` (`Slappy826#0001` on Discord) created a one-line patch for Wine that allowed the Roblox Player to work again on a GNU/Linux or BSD system.

This patch was released in the development release of Wine 6.11. Here are the steps on installing it on Ubuntu:

1. Add the repository key

```sh
# Add repository key
wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
sudo apt-key add winehq.key
```

2. Add the repository. Consult this [table](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu#:~:text=Add%20the%20repository:) for the command to run.

```sh
# Add the repository
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/ focal main'
```

3. Install Grapejuice and its dependencies

```sh
# Update packages
sudo apt update

# GrapeJuice Dependencies (https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice)
sudo apt install -y wine wine64 wine32 git python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel python3-dev pkg-config libcairo2-dev libdbus-1-dev gtk-update-icon-cache desktop-file-utils xdg-utils libgirepository1.0-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0
sudo apt install -y --install-recommends winehq-devel # Install the 6.11 development branch

# Installing GrapeJuice
git clone https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice.git
cd grapejuice
python3 ./install.py
```

4. Search for Grapejuice through your applications and open it up
5. Click on `Maintenance > Install Roblox`

And you are done!
